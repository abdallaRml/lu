        "# Regular Expressions and BeautifulSoup\n",
        "If the previous section on regular expressions seemed a little disjointed from the mis‐ sion of this book, here’s where it all ties together. BeautifulSoup and regular expres‐ sions go hand in hand when it comes to scraping the web. In fact, most functions that take in a string argument (e.g., find(id=\"aTagIdHere\")) will also take in a regular expression just as well.\n",
        "Let’s take a look at some examples, scraping the page found at http://www.python‐ scraping.com/pages/page3.html.\n",
        "Notice that the site has many product images, which take the following form:\n",
        "< img src=\"../img/gifts/img3.jpg\">\n",
        "If you wanted to grab URLs to all of the product images, it might seem fairly straight‐ forward at first: just grab all the image tags by using .find_all(\"img\"), right? But there’s a problem. In addition to the obvious “extra” images (e.g., logos), modern web sites often have hidden images, blank images used for spacing and aligning elements, and other random image tags you might not be aware of. Certainly, you can’t count on the only images on the page being product images.\n",
        "Let’s also assume that the layout of the page might change, or that, for whatever rea‐ son, you don’t want to depend on the position of the image in the page in order to find the correct tag. This might be the case when you are trying to grab specific ele‐ ments or pieces of data that are scattered randomly throughout a website. For instance, a featured product image might appear in a special layout at the top of some pages, but not others.\n",
        "The solution is to look for something identifying about the tag itself. In this case, you can look at the file path of the product images:\n",
